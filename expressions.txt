  Reality demonstrates itself in a tone of absoluteness. There is no true control, normativity reigns supreme.

  Slowing down allows us to focus our attention and truly experience the complexity and richness of time. When we take slow, mindful breaths, we become aware of our own existence and the vastness of the world around us. Our narrow concerns fade away, and we are able to fully appreciate the intricate web of existence in which we are a part.

  Consequence is a meta-temporal concept, and has little traction upon non-static non-type/object oriented thinking, it is physical and proccessual not narrativistic or semantic.

  The right music at the right time, mends old wounds and brings release. 

  Returning to aesthetics, like a corpse to the sublimity of rebirth, from out of atelic duty with a new found loss of the sense of the trancendent sourced from pragmatic, utilitarian, and instrumental interest.  

  A dreadful thought, to count all the times one must essentially start over in life, be it with relationships, a move, or change of business.. so much waste, so much hurt, the repetition is torturous. Stronger not dead, sure, but at what cost?

  It hurts to be alive. You can have whatever. It still hurts.

  Someone loses a part of their body, and it doesn't grow back, the future of their existence is marked by that. The absolute unabsoluteness of the future, the absolute unabsoluteness of the past, the absolute unabsoluteness of the circumstances facilitating what it is like to be alive frightens.

  Condemed to freedom? Hah, condemed to making due with limitation, freedom being what is indivudated in a negative sense. Someone define some positive content for be-ing!

  To choose from a pile of mediocrity is hardly choosing at all. Such freedom, wow, shitpost equivalent of spiritual nourishment.

  Life is a perpetual balancing act between stability and growth. Too much of either can lead to stagnation or chaos.

  The human condition is one of constant longing. We seek love, validation, success, and happiness, but even when we attain them, they are fleeting and incomplete.

  Our perception of reality is limited by our senses and biases. What we perceive as objective truth is often shaped by our subjective experiences.

  Time is both a gift and a curse. It allows for growth and change, but also brings loss and impermanence.

  To truly understand someone, we must listen without judgment or agenda. Only then can we connect on a deeper level and cultivate empathy.

  The pursuit of knowledge is a never-ending journey. The more we learn, the more we realize how much we don't know.

  The line between genius and madness is often blurred. Both require a willingness to think outside the box and challenge conventional wisdom.

  Change is the only constant in life, and learning to embrace it can lead to personal growth and fulfillment.

  Love is a force that transcends boundaries of time, space, and logic. It can bring both joy and pain, but ultimately, it is what gives life its meaning.

  We are all searching for purpose in life, but sometimes the journey is more important than the destination.

  A love that is broken is not an end, but a beginning. It is the shattered fragments that become the seeds of a new growth, a new hope.

  It is easy to see love as a form of possession, as something we can own or control. But true love, like the will to a sense of freedom, is a force that transcends ownership.

  When we love, we risk everything. We risk our hearts, our minds, our very souls. It is worth it to feel.

  Existence in the face of normativity, one can not deny their subjective experience. The process of individuation demands the disintegration of the symbolic order, leaving one to face the void.

To live in the world is to be bound by normativity, yet individuality emerges in the realization of the subjective experience that is delimited by the symbolic order, a kind of freeom through the law againt itself into a new meta-stable shape bound to an individual or as a compehensive set of traits/aboutnesses if we're avoiding object talk.

The subjective experience of the individual is both bounded and liberated by the symbolic order, which creates the possibility of transcendence while simultaneously hemming in individuality.

To be a self is to be situated within a symbolic order that is both enabling and constraining. It is only by confronting the limits of this order that the individual can emerge as a subjective entity.

The process of individuation is a journey towards the realization of one's subjective experience, which is both bounded and facilitated by the symbolic order.

The heart is a maze of contradictions, a labyrinth of desires and fears that can never be fully mapped or understood. Love is the thread that leads us out of the maze, but it can also tangle us up in knots.

Freedom lies not in the absolute absence of constraint, but in the ability to creatively navigate the boundaries of what is given. Knowing full well that the bounds of giveness might not be fixed, but renegotiable given as it is a myth that givenness is given givenly.

The symbolic order shapes our subjective experience in ways that are often invisible to us, but nonetheless profound. To challenge it is to enter into a struggle that may require the upending of cherished beliefs and habits.

To be human is to live with the awareness of our own mortality, and to confront the anxiety that it engenders. But it is also to embrace the urgency of our limited time, and to find meaning in the small moments that make up our lives.

The pain of love sickness is the price we pay for the privilege of loving, the tax on our hearts for the joy of connection.

The metamodern subject is one who embraces the paradoxical nature of trauma and love sickness, who finds beauty in the midst of pain and meaning in the face of despair.

In a digital abyss of hyperreality, love becomes an algorithm that computes and models our desires and their meta-rationality.

The self is not a static entity, but a process of becoming. Through the experience of love and pain, we are constantly transformed and remade. Only by embracing this process can we fully realize our potential and our place in the world.

The external world in many ways has the quality of being a mirror of subjectivity's setup and valence proportions, reflecting our own desires and fears back to us. Through introspection and self-reflection, we can come to a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the universe.

The dialectic of love and reason can renew the bread and butter of subjectivity. Love, as a subjective feeling, is the immediate expression of the subject, but reason, as objective mediation, allows a reconcilation with the other and the world.

Desperation is a poor substitute for integrity; it may gain you something in the short term, but ultimately it will cost you everything.

Intuition, driven by life's blind force, enables problem-solving and negentropic growth in beings without subjectivity.

The content of experience, whether real or simulated, must be determined by a reality outside itself, as simulations are simulated by something external to them.

Possible constructions of intuitive logic inherit the consistency of the outside world, as the subject cannot be separate from itself as an object of actuality.

God is Nothing because the concept of truth is not the truth itself, leaving us searching for more than a trace, unaware that reality is already present without being given to us.
